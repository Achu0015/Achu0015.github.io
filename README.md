This is a simple Pig-Game with customized rules, which follows as :
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on either of dices, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach "Final Score" points on GLOBAL score wins the game.

We can set the final score of our wish to win the game.
